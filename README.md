### This base container is not aimed at public consumption. It exists to serve as a single endpoint for AntilaX-3 containers and is based upon [Alpine Linux](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/) and [S6 overlay](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) forked from [linuxserver.io](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-baseimage-alpine).
